# Learning-Python
Completing the first real lesson in Udacity Full-stack program and lessons from the Introduction to
Python Programming Udacity program.

The files in this library are various small functions and tasks completed as part of the aforementioned
Udacity programs as I incrase my understanding of Python's syntax and quirks. Files in mini-projects 
are things I made more on my own with the classes' guidelines, where heavily-guided-exercises range
from copy-pasted test cases to see how things worked to code we were walked through line by line.
